The machine learning part: our model takes preprocessing
steps and choose 80% as the train set from the women's e-commerce
dataset. We used nltk package to conduct basic NLP processes and 
then compared clustering methods of the result. Our model is able to
predict whether comments  are a sign of postive feedback or negative
feedback. 

For furthur utilization of machine learning, please modify the notebook file
under machine learning folder.
